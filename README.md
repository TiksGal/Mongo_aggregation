Project Title: PyMongo Aggregation Pipelines Testing

Description: This project aims to implement and test various MongoDB aggregation pipelines using PyMongo. We will create Python scripts that demonstrate how to filter, sort, project, and combine these operations in PyMongo. We'll use different MongoDB collections for each pipeline to provide diverse testing scenarios.

The project will include:

A proper object-oriented implementation.
Schema validation where necessary.
Comprehensive error handling.
Documentation explaining the use and functionality of each script.
A well-structured GitHub repository containing all project files.
Here's a detailed breakdown of the subtasks:

Setting up the project environment:

Initial project setup (GitHub repository, .gitignore file, README.md, etc.).
Create and configure a virtual environment for Python.
Install necessary packages (pymongo).
Designing and implementing PyMongo classes and functions:

Define classes to represent MongoDB collections.
Implement methods for different types of aggregation pipelines (filtering, sorting, projecting, combined).
Implement methods for error handling.
Include schema validation if applicable.
Testing the PyMongo aggregation pipelines:

Set up test databases and collections.
Define tests for each type of pipeline.
Run tests and adjust the code as necessary.
